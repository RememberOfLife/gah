# GAH

Generative art helpers, written in GO.

All coordinate systems use the common graphics axes (unless otherwise specified):
```
O-->X
|
v
Y
```

**Expect major breaking changes.**

## TODOs

* ColorRamp2D
* different interpolation functions for mix and colorramp
* deduplicate noise layering loops
* properly domainwarping noise
